Play with Linux subsystem for windows \w/

# You may need this

I started this project because I want to do some interaction between Windows NT and Linux subsystem.

And for some reason, after doing some reverse engineering I turn to do some else and have no time.

And I found this repo https://github.com/ionescu007/lxss and I think this has achieved everything I want to do.
